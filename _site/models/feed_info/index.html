<h2>FeedInfo</h2>
<blockquote class="subtitle">
<p class="subtitle">Additional information about the feed itself, including publisher, version, and expiration information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The file contains information about the feed itself, rather than the services that the feed describes. <span class="caps">GTFS</span> currently has an agency.txt file to provide information about the agencies that operate the services described by the feed. However, the publisher of the feed is sometimes a different entity than any of the agencies (in the case of regional aggregators). In addition, there are some fields that are really feed-wide settings, rather than agency-wide.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Fields</h3>
<h4>feed_publisher_name <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>feed_publisher_name</strong> field contains the full name of the organization that publishes the feed. (This may be the same as one of the <strong>agency_name</strong> values in agency.txt.) <span class="caps">GTFS</span>-consuming applications can display this name when giving attribution for a particular feed&#8217;s data.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>feed_publisher_url <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>feed_publisher_url</strong> field contains the <span class="caps">URL</span> of the feed publishing organization&#8217;s website. (This may be the same as one of the <strong>agency_url</strong> values in agency.txt.) The value must be a fully qualified <span class="caps">URL</span> that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the <span class="caps">URL</span> must be correctly escaped. See http://www.w3.org/Addressing/<span class="caps">URL</span>/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified <span class="caps">URL</span> values.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>feed_lang <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>feed_lang</strong> field contains a <span class="caps">IETF</span> <span class="caps">BCP</span> 47 language code specifying the default language used for the text in this feed. This setting helps <span class="caps">GTFS</span> consumers choose capitalization rules and other language-specific settings for the feed. For an introduction to <span class="caps">IETF</span> <span class="caps">BCP</span> 47, please refer to http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt and http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>feed_start_date</h4>
<p>The feed provides complete and reliable schedule information for service in the period from the beginning of the <strong>feed_start_date</strong> day to the end of the <strong>feed_end_date</strong> day. Both days are given as dates in <span class="caps">YYYYMMDD</span> format as for calendar.txt, or left empty if unavailable. The <strong>feed_end_date</strong> date must not precede the <strong>feed_start_date</strong> date if both are given. Feed providers are encouraged to give schedule data outside this period to advise of likely future service, but feed<br />
consumers should treat it mindful of its non-authoritative status. If <strong>feed_start_date</strong> or <strong>feed_end_date</strong> extend beyond the active calendar dates defined in calendar.txt and calendar_dates.txt, the feed is making an explicit assertion that there is no service for dates within the <strong>feed_start_date</strong> or <strong>feed_end_date</strong> range but not included in the active calendar dates.</p>
<h4>feed_end_date</h4>
<h4>feed_version</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The feed publisher can specify a string here that indicates the current version of their <span class="caps">GTFS</span> feed. <span class="caps">GTFS</span>-consuming applications can display this value to help feed publishers determine whether the latest version of their feed has been incorporated.</p>
