<h2>Stop <span>(required)</span></h2>
<blockquote class="subtitle">
<p class="subtitle">Individual locations where vehicles pick up or drop off passengers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Fields</h3>
<h4>stop_id <span>(required; unique)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>stop_id</strong> field contains an ID that uniquely identifies a stop or station. Multiple routes may use the same stop. The <strong>stop_id</strong> is dataset unique.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>stop_code</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>stop_code</strong> field contains short text or a number that uniquely identifies the stop for passengers. Stop codes are often used in phone-based transit information systems or printed on stop signage to make it easier for riders to get a stop schedule or real-time arrival information for a particular stop.</p>
<p>The <strong>stop_code</strong> field should only be used for stop codes that are displayed to passengers. For internal codes, use <strong>stop_id</strong>. This field should be left blank for stops without a code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>stop_name <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>stop_name</strong> field contains the name of a stop or station. Please use a name that people will understand in the local and tourist vernacular.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>stop_desc</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>stop_desc</strong> field contains a description of a stop. Please provide useful, quality information. Do not simply duplicate the name of the stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>stop_lat <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The stop_lat field contains the latitude of a stop or station. The field value must be a valid <span class="caps">WGS</span> 84 latitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>stop_lon <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The stop_lon field contains the longitude of a stop or station. The field value must be a valid <span class="caps">WGS</span> 84 longitude value from -180 to 180.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>zone_id</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>zone_id</strong> field defines the fare zone for a stop ID. Zone IDs are required if you want to provide fare information using fare_rules.txt. If this stop ID represents a station, the zone ID is ignored.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>stop_url</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>stop_url</strong> field contains the <span class="caps">URL</span> of a web page about a particular stop. This should be different from the <strong>agency_url</strong> and the <strong>route_url</strong> fields.</p>
<p>The value must be a fully qualified <span class="caps">URL</span> that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the <span class="caps">URL</span> must be correctly escaped. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html">W3.org: <span class="caps">URI</span> Recommendations</a> for a description of how to create fully qualified <span class="caps">URL</span> values.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>location_type</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>location_type</strong> field identifies whether this stop ID represents a stop or station. If no location type is specified, or the location_type is blank, stop IDs are treated as stops. Stations may have different properties from stops when they are represented on a map or used in trip planning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The location type field can have the following values:</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
	<dt>0 or blank</dt>
	<dd>Stop. A location where passengers board or disembark from a transit vehicle.</dd>
	<dt>1</dt>
	<dd>Station. A physical structure or area that contains one or more stop.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>parent_station</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>For stops that are physically located inside stations, the <strong>parent_station</strong> field identifies the station associated with the stop. To use this field, stops.txt must also contain a row where this stop ID is assigned location type=1.</p>
</blockquote>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>This stop is&#8230;</th>
		<th>location_type is&#8230;</th>
		<th>parent_station contains&#8230;</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>located inside a station.</td>
		<td>0 or blank </td>
		<td>The stop ID of the station where this stop is located. The stop referenced by parent_station must have location_type=1.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>located outside a station.</td>
		<td>0 or blank</td>
		<td>A blank value. The parent_station field doesn&#8217;t apply to this stop.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>a station.</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>A blank value. Stations can&#8217;t contain other stations.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h4>stop_timezone</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>stop_timezone</strong> field contains the timezone in which this stop or station is located. Please refer to Wikipedia List of Timezones for a list of valid values. If omitted, the stop should be assumed to be located in the timezone specified by agency_timezone in agency.txt.</p>
<p>When a stop has a parent station, the stop is considered to be in the timezone specified by the parent station&#8217;s <strong>stop_timezone</strong> value. If the parent has no <strong>stop_timezone</strong> value, the stops that belong to that station are assumed to be in the timezone specified by <strong>agency_timezone</strong>, even if the stops have their own <strong>stop_timezone</strong> values. In other words, if a given stop has a <strong>parent_station</strong> value, any <strong>stop_timezone</strong> value specified for that stop must be ignored.</p>
<p>Even if <strong>stop_timezone</strong> values are provided in stops.txt, the times in stop_times.txt should continue to be specified as time since midnight in the timezone specified by <strong>agency_timezone</strong> in agency.txt. This ensures that the time values in a trip always increase over the course of a trip, regardless of which timezones the trip crosses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>wheelchair_boarding</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>wheelchair_boarding</strong> field identifies whether wheelchair boardings are possible from the specified stop or station. The field can have the following values:</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
	<dt>0 (or empty)</dt>
	<dd>indicates that there is no accessibility information for the stop</dd>
	<dt>1</dt>
	<dd>indicates that at least some vehicles at this stop can be boarded by a rider in a wheelchair</dd>
	<dt>2</dt>
	<dd>wheelchair boarding is not possible at this stop</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>When a stop is part of a larger station complex, as indicated by a stop with a <strong>parent_station</strong> value, the stop&#8217;s <strong>wheelchair_boarding</strong> field has the following additional semantics:</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
	<dt>0 (or empty)</dt>
	<dd>the stop will inherit its <strong>wheelchair_boarding</strong> value from the parent station, if specified in the parent</dd>
	<dt>1</dt>
	<dd>there exists some accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop / platform</dd>
	<dt>2</dt>
	<dd>there exists no accessible path from outside the station to the specific stop / platform</dd>
</dl>
