<h2>Frequency</h2>
<blockquote class="subtitle">
<p class="subtitle">Headway (time between trips) for routes with variable frequency of service.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This table is intended to represent schedules that don&#8217;t have a fixed list of stop times. When trips are defined in frequencies.txt, the trip planner ignores the absolute values of the arrival_time and departure_time fields for those trips in stop_times.txt. Instead, the stop_times table defines the sequence of stops and the time difference between each stop.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Fields</h3>
<h4>trip_id <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>trip_id</strong> contains an ID that identifies a trip on which the specified frequency of service applies. Trip IDs are referenced from the trips.txt file.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>start_time <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>start_time</strong> field specifies the time at which service begins with the specified frequency. The time is measured from &#8220;noon minus 12h&#8221; (effectively midnight, except for days on which daylight savings time changes occur) at the beginning of the service date. For times occurring after midnight, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. E.g. 25:35:00.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>end_time <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>end_time</strong> field indicates the time at which service changes to a different frequency (or ceases) at the first stop in the trip. The time is measured from &#8220;noon minus 12h&#8221; (effectively midnight, except for days on which daylight savings time changes occur) at the beginning of the service date. For times occurring after midnight, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. E.g. 25:35:00.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>headway_secs <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>headway_secs</strong> field indicates the time between departures from the same stop (headway) for this trip type, during the time interval specified by <strong>start_time</strong> and <strong>end_time</strong>. The headway value must be entered in seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Periods in which headways are defined (the rows in frequencies.txt) shouldn&#8217;t overlap for the same trip, since it&#8217;s hard to determine what should be inferred from two overlapping headways. However, a headway period may begin at the exact same time that another one ends, for instance:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>
A, 05:00:00, 07:00:00, 600
B, 07:00:00, 12:00:00, 1200 
</pre>
<h4>exact_times</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>exact_times</strong> field determines if frequency-based trips should be exactly scheduled based on the specified headway information. Valid values for this field are:</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
	<dt>0 or (empty)</dt>
	<dd>Frequency-based trips are not exactly scheduled. This is the default behavior.</dd>
	<dt>1</dt>
	<dd>Frequency-based trips are exactly scheduled. For a frequencies.txt row, trips are scheduled starting with trip_start_time = start_time + x * headway_secs for all x in (0, 1, 2, &#8230;) where trip_start_time &lt; end_time.</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of <strong>exact_times</strong> must be the same for all frequencies.txt rows with the same <strong>trip_id</strong>. If <strong>exact_times</strong> is 1 and a frequencies.txt row has a <strong>start_time</strong> equal to <strong>end_time</strong>, no trip must be scheduled. When <strong>exact_times</strong> is 1, care must be taken to choose an <strong>end_time</strong> value that is greater than the last desired trip start time but less than the last desired trip start time + <strong>headway_secs</strong>.</p>
