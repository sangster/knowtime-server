<h2>Transfer</h2>
<blockquote class="subtitle">
<p class="subtitle">Rules for making connections at transfer points between routes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Trip planners normally calculate transfer points based on the relative proximity of stops in each route. For potentially ambiguous stop pairs, or transfers where you want to specify a particular choice, use transfers.txt to define additional rules for making connections between routes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Fields</h3>
<h4>from_stop_id <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>from_stop_id</strong> field contains a stop ID that identifies a stop or station where a connection between routes begins. Stop IDs are referenced from the stops.txt file. If the stop ID refers to a station that contains multiple stops, this transfer rule applies to all stops in that station.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>to_stop_id <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>to_stop_id</strong> field contains a stop ID that identifies a stop or station where a connection between routes ends. Stop IDs are referenced from the stops.txt file. If the stop ID refers to a station that contains multiple stops, this transfer rule applies to all stops in that station.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>transfer_type <span>(required)</span></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>transfer_type</strong> field specifies the type of connection for the specified (from_stop_id, to_stop_id) pair. Valid values for this field are:</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
	<dt>0 or (empty)</dt>
	<dd>This is a recommended transfer point between two routes.</dd>
	<dt>1</dt>
	<dd>This is a timed transfer point between two routes. The departing vehicle is expected to wait for the arriving one, with sufficient time for a passenger to transfer between routes.</dd>
	<dt>2</dt>
	<dd>This transfer requires a minimum amount of time between arrival and departure to ensure a connection. The time required to transfer is specified by <strong>min_transfer_time</strong>.</dd>
	<dt>3</dt>
	<dd>Transfers are not possible between routes at this location.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>min_transfer_time</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When a connection between routes requires an amount of time between arrival and departure (transfer_type=2), the <strong>min_transfer_time</strong> field defines the amount of time that must be available in an itinerary to permit a transfer between routes at these stops. The <strong>min_transfer_time</strong> must be sufficient to permit a typical rider to move between the two stops, including buffer time to allow for schedule variance on each route.</p>
<p>The <strong>min_transfer_time</strong> value must be entered in seconds, and must be a non-negative integer.</p>
<p></p>
